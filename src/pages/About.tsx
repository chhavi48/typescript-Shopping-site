 About </h1>
        <p style={{fontSize:"20px"}}>Iwasn’t aware of the term “bibliomemoir” until the novelist Joyce Carol Oates used it – or perhaps coined it? – in reviewing my book, The Road to Middlemarch, earlier this year. But it’s a fitting enough label for the extended family my book belongs to: books that explicitly consider reading as a crucial dimension of living, or that explore the post-publication life that a significant book has led.
 <br/>
As I was writing my book my husband, George Prochnik, was the other end of our house writing his own, The Impossible Exile: Stefan Zweig at the End of the World, about the mid-century <br/>Austrian writer. It was not until both books were published that we realised they were, in a sense, twins: his concerned with the disorientating anguish of exile, and mine with the melancholy joy of homecoming.
